    A keystore wallet file, is a file that contains your USDP wallet account's private key encrypted with a password of your choice. You should choose a sufficiently strong password, this allows you to store the keystore file and not worry about hacks. This keystore file and your password are VERY IMPORTANT.You need to make sure you back up this file and your password so that youcannot lose them. USDP does NOT store your keystore file or password. If you lose either one, your wallet will be UNRECOVERABLE.
