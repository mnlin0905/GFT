    A private key is a secret number that allows assets to be spent. During the transaction on blockchain, private key is used to generate the digital signature for the payment to prove the assets ownership. Because private key controls your assets, it is important that these are kept secure. Private key is different from keystore which is an encrypted private key file. It is difficult to hack a keystore file without the password.

    The private key is generated and managed by wallet and is completely independent, do not need internet connection or blockchain platform. The private key is mathematically calculated by public key with SECP256K1. It is a string of 29 characters, for example: xptBZL7s1NXEfZaMjwjmiPGU7QfQJ.
